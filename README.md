2. Ensure that your machine meets the requirements from single node deployment for Edge Essentials. For a successful install, you will also need to ensure:
    - No VPN connection 
    - No existing eFlow, or other Kubernetes setup on the system 
    - Static wifi configuration during the installation

<br/>

3. Navigate to the folder where you want you download the install script and click ‚Äúselect folder‚Äù 

4. Once the script is downloaded, the extension automatically opens a powershell console and ask for admin privilege to run the installation script.

5. Your cluster will appear in the Native K8s Cluster view. Click the connect to Arc button to Arc enable your cluster.

   - To Arc enable your cluster, you'll need to add connectedk8s extension and register some namespaces.
   ```powershell
   az extension add --name connectedk8s
   ```
   ```
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation
   ```
   - Monitor the registration process. Registration may take up to 10 minutes.
   ```
   az provider show -n Microsoft.Kubernetes -o table
   az provider show -n Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration -o table
   az provider show -n Microsoft.ExtendedLocation -o table
   ```
6. Your cluster will appear in the Native K8s Cluster view. Click the connect to Arc button to Arc enable your cluster. 

7. Using the command palette, please provide an azure subscription, resource group and a name for your cluster.

> - Note: This environment is intended to be used for development and testing purposes only. You are able to use this environment for 30 days for free once you connect to Arc.
